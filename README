=================================== BEWARE! ===================================
  This is a *DEVELOPMENT* branch of the *DEVELOPMENT* trunk of libfreefare!
  While the trunk trends to be somewhat stable and tested code, this branch
  holds experimental and work-in-progress developments.

  This means NO SUPPORT AT ALL!
=================================== BEWARE! ===================================

PREREQUISITES

  Since the libnfc has an ISO/IEC 144443 CRC built-in that is required for
  some Mifare DESFire operations, the libnfc-r324-export-iso14443a_crc.patch
  patch has to be applied to the libnfc's trunk before attempting to compile
  this library.

MISCELLANEOUS

  To ease up development, the FreeBSD's hexdump(1) code has been included in
  this source tree.  If you are running a system which provides this function
  in libutil (at least FreeBSD), edit the libfreefare/Makefile.am file to suit
  your system's settings.

  The BSD-licensed files included for the debugging purpose are:
    - libutil.h
    - libfreefare/hexdump.c

================================================================================

The libfreefare project aims to provide a convenient API for Mifare card
manipulations.
