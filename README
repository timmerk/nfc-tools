README for pam_nfc
==================

pam_nfc is a NFC-based PAM authentification module.

Using pam_nfc, you can use NFC (Near Field Communication) cards / tags to
autohrise users into PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules).

Security consideration
----------------------

Since tag IDs cannot be trusted, you SHOULD not only rely on them to grant
access to the machine to users.  You SHOULD only consider this PAM module as a
convenient way for a user to tell his own machine who he is.

Basically, the NFC reader is physically connected to the computer, so if an
user has a physical access to the NFC intiator, he also has physical access to
the computer, and thus strong authentification is already of no luck.
